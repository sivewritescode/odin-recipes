    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Corn on the cob is cooked in boiled water with a little sugar and lemon 
      juice for the sweetest, tastiest corn. My mother-in-law gave me this easy 
      recipe. Top the cooked corn with butter and a pinch of salt for the best 
      summer side dish there is!
